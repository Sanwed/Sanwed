## Hello there 👋

I am Alex, a Middle Frontend Developer based in Russia.

I mostly work on any E-Commerce frontend stuff – Vue 3, Nuxt 3, Typescript, Tailwind, SCSS and a bit of React and Next.js

I also use Figma for UI design of my pet-projects and any interesting ideas.

I publish here my pet-projects and educational repos for my YouTube channel.

## Tools & Tech
